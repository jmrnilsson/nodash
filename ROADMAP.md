+ `isDigit` vs `isNumeric` (single character or whole string?)
+ `isAsciiLetter` â†’ single character or whole string?
+ Support streams in all functions that could support streams.
+ Devise and benchmark different ways of implementing streams
  (currently functions, what about immutable singly linked lists?)
+ Implement remaining functions from `Data.List` (`permutations`, ...)
+ Benchmark more functions
+ Document all functions including examples and signatures
+ Create try-it-out
+ Create examples/gallery
+ Is `until` in the proper group @ `Control`?
+ `isAllUpper` that checks `isUpper` and `all(isLetter)`?
+ or change `isUpper`?
+ ditto: `isAllLower` and `isLower`?
+ what about `isLetter` (unicode aware)
+ support unicode code points beyond U+10000
