<p><strong><em>nodash</em></strong> offers you a rich set of library functions, comparable to
the likes of <a href="http://underscorejs.org/"><strong><em>underscore</em></strong></a>
or <a href="https://lodash.com/"><strong><em>lodash</em></strong></a>.
The functions are actually derived
from the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.7.0.0/docs/Prelude.html"><strong><em>Haskell Prelude</em></strong></a>
and emphasize a functional programming style.</p>
<p>A special
trait of this library is that it discards some JavaScript concepts (like
<code>this</code>) to allow some (in the authors opinion) more useful ones. Every function
from this library can be thought of as <em>curried</em>, i.e. you can partially apply
any function and get a function in return (on the other hand this means there are
no optional arguments). Also you have a distinction between <em>lists</em> and <em>streams</em>
and it can cope with <em>infinite streams</em>.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>A port of the Haskell Prelude to JavaScript/NodeJS.</p>
<pre><code>npm install --save nodash
</code></pre><pre><code class="lang-JavaScript">// install it globally
require(&#39;nodash&#39;).install(GLOBAL);

var reverse = foldl(flip(cons), []);

// have it in a variable P
var P = require(&#39;nodash&#39;);

var reverse = P.foldl(P.flip(P.cons), []);

// have it in a variable Prelude
var Prelude = require(&#39;nodash&#39;);

var reverse = Prelude.foldl(Prelude.flip(Prelude.cons), []);

// I think you get my drift.
